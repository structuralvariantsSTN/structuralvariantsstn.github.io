### We are organising a series of online seminars on “The evolutionary role of structural variants”. 
We aim to highlight:  
(i) genomic/bioinformatic approaches to characterize structural variants and assess their evolutionary implications,  
(ii) experimental/ecological approaches to test the role of structural variants in adaptation and diversification,   
(iii) theoretical modelling of the interplay between selection, structural variants and speciation, (iv) population genomics studies investigating the eco-evolutionary factors underlying the distribution and frequency of structural variants.

Talks will be on the last Wednesday of each month, starting in April 2026 (except for  summer/winter breaks). We plan to alternate between times convenient for different time zones. Talks and questions will be recorded and posted on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@structuralvariantsSTN).
