<b>About us</b>
STRiVE is a Special Topic Network funded since 2025 by the European Society for Evolutionary Biology [insert link]. This program aims to complement the ESEB congress by building links across the community of evolutionary biology, focused on a timely research field.
Our STN is a global community of evolutionary biologists, genomicists, theoreticians, and experimental researchers aiming to address the evolutionary role of structural genomic variation. The network brings together a diverse range of expertise, including population genomics, ecology, chromosome biology, cytogenetics, bioinformatics, and evolutionary theory, fostering exchange across disciplines. Our community spans continents, study systems, and evolutionary scales—from within-population variation to macroevolutionary phylogenetic divergence—across animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes. Through meetings, collaborative research, training activities, and shared resources, the network provides a platform to develop concepts, methods, and people needed to advance structural variant research in evolutionary biology.
