### In person and online training
We are currently planning method-oriented workshops, promoting best practices to unify the detection and analysis of structural variants within an evolutionary framework. 

Stay tuned for workshop and summer school announcements

Course materials, including online tutorials, hands-on training datasets, and open pipelines, will be posted on this platform.
