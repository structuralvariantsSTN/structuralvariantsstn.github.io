Welcome to the [ESEB](https://eseb.org/) Special Topic Network on the evolutionary role of structural genomic variation (STRiVE). Our network was established in 2025 and brings together researchers from across the globe to study how structural variants, ranging from transposable elements to large chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions or fusions and fissions, shape genome evolution, adaptation, and speciation. 

Through collaborative research, standardised methods, seminars, meetings, and training initiatives, we aim to bridge communities and unlock the diversity of structural variants and their evolutionary implications across the Tree of Life.
