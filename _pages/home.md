Welcome to the [ESEB](https://eseb.org/) Special Topic Network on the evolutionary role of structural genomic variation (STRiVE). Our network was established in 2025 and brings together researchers from across the globe to study how structural variants, ranging from transposable elements to large chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions or fusions and fissions, shape genome evolution, adaptation, and speciation. Through collaborative research, standardised methods, seminars, meetings, and training initiatives, we aim to bridge communities and unlock the diversity of structural variants and their evolutionary implications across the Tree of Life.

<br>
<b>Join us in Portugal for our kick-off conference!</b>

We are excited to announce our inaugural conference near Porto, Portugal (8th to 10th of July 2026), bringing together researchers to launch this Special Topic Network. This event will feature cutting-edge research presentations, foster interdisciplinary discussions, and initiate collaborative projects spanning the breadth of structural variant research. Connect with colleagues working on inversions, transposable elements, duplications, chromosomal rearrangements, 3D genomics and more, across animals, plants, fungi, and diverse evolutionary scales

<b>Contribute to the open special issue in JEB</b>

We have the pleasure to be associated with the Journal of Evolutionary Biology (JEB) published by ESEB,  editing a special issue about “Genome Architecture and Evolution: How Structural and Genetic Variation Shapes Biodiversity.” Submissions are open until June 2026. Please contact [Marcial Escudero](https://marcialescuderolab.weebly.com/) if you are interested in contributing.

<br>
<b>Online seminar series launching soon</b>

Stay tuned for our upcoming online [seminar series](https://structuralvariantsstn.github.io/seminars/) focusing on structural variants in evolution! These seminars will showcase diverse approaches — from pangenome analyses and experimental studies to theoretical modelling — creating unique opportunities for cross-disciplinary exchange and interactions.

Missed a seminar? No problem - you can find them on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@structuralvariantsSTN).

<b>How to take part in STRiVE?</b>
Join us to explore how structural variants drive adaptation, speciation, and genome evolution across taxa. Most activities are open to all network members and interested ESEB participants.
