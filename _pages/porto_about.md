We are excited to announce our inaugural conference at CIBIO-BIOPOLIS in Vila do Conde (near Porto), Portugal (8th to 10th of July 2026), bringing together researchers to launch the Special Topic Network STRIVE.
 
This event named “Trends in Biodiversity and Evolution: the evolutionary role of structural genomic variation” (TiBE-STRiVE)” will feature cutting-edge research presentations, foster interdisciplinary discussions, and initiate collaborative projects spanning the breadth of structural variant research. 

Registration will open on Feb 25th for members of the network and in early March for non-members.  

Venue: Quinta do Crasto, an old farm and agriculture museum recently converted in a Biodiversity research laboratory: CIBIO- Associaçao BIOPOLIS
